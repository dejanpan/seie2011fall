ToDo
----------

1. testing rgbdicp
	-different pointclouds
	-varying texture/geometry etc.
	-do some metric, write results
	-experiment with parameters; alpha, ransac rejection rates
	-dense correspondence rejection - boundery points (due to bogas planes)
	-investigate depth error affecting joint icp

	-write up 1 page on results, change error metric
	-look into original icp paper for icp metric

2. integrate into rgbdslam
	-test comparing with original

3. Demo/paper for the conference in April
	-Working version of the above code

-Plane registration
	-read paper, think about implementation

-Segmentation
	-lucci code

-Collect data
	-go into homes
	-kinect at home

-Mesh reconstruction/ikea model demo
	-bug dejan to run his code


-Mapping for Fraunhoffer - find out how to map an entire room with running into memory/processing problems
	-Will this be needed?
