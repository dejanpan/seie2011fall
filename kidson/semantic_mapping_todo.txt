1. Create releasable code
-------------------------------
-RGBDSLAM release version
	checkout stock rgbdslam version, add required mods
	-cache/delete point clouds
	-point cloud skip step
	-bagfile creater (for dejans code)
	-parameters (min matches etc)
	-euclidean distance check for adding edges
	-sensor model

-Frame to frame registration
	-copy/test ransac
	-icp/feature joint optimization


2. Test RGBDSLAM on multiple kitchens
-------------------------------------
-4 datasets
	-IAS labs (gorden, 5th floor)
	-My kitchen
	-Dejans kitchen

3. Test RGBDLSAM with new data and feedback to juergen

4. Semantic Mapping

5. Building models with vlads code

Semantic Mapping Notes
---------------------------------------------
 1. Segment Planes
 2. Segment Fixtures
 3. Segment Drawers
     - Use kinect video to obtain motion model
     - Do this with the robot or without the robot
     --> Juergens code to articulate the robot
 4. Reconstruction - generate mesh from kitchen
 5. Association - between point cloud and mesh
GUI can select mesh or point cloud for visualization

GUI
-----

- 1, 2 or 3 are selectable to segment
- 3 Requires taking a kinect to the environment to show the drawer motion.
     -requires registration from kinect video to known model
     -be able to show drawer articulation and motion model
- Merging and splitting of sections possible
- Deal with over/under segmentation
- Manual Segmentation
     - Doors --> specular or see through
     - Non visible handles (e.g. washing mashines with recessed handles)
