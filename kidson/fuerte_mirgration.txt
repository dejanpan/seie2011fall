ROS
------

Error 'ROS_WARN' was not declared in this scope (or 'ROS_INFO' or 'ROS_DEBUG')

#include <ros/console.h>

Eigen
--------------

change 
<depend package="eigen"/>
to 
<rosdep name="eigen"/>

add to cmake:
find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)
include_directories(${EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIRS})

no linking required

http://ros.org/wiki/eigen

openCV
---------

Ros fuerte uses opencv2.4 instead of 2.3.  A lot has seemed to have changed

the header files will most likely need to change
for instance to include sift/surf feature detection you now need to include 	
 "opencv2/core/core.hpp"
 "opencv2/features2d/features2d.hpp"
 "opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp"
 "opencv2/nonfree/nonfree.hpp"

This may vary, look in /opt/ros/fuerte/include/opencv2 to find the relevant header files.

in manifest:
  <rosdep name="opencv2"/>

and add to your cmake

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${OpenCV_LIBRARY_DIRS})

----- and after adding the target

target_link_libraries(tester ${OpenCV_LIBS})

http://ros.org/wiki/opencv2

PCL
----

the PCL stack in fuerte is an empty stack with pcl 1.5 existing as an external library in 
/opt/ros/fuerte/include/pcl-1.5

if you need pcl 1.6 you can get it by installing 
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-fuerte-unstable

you can then find the pcl package "pcl16"
use this by adding it to the manifest file
<depend package="pcl16"/>

However this package contains pcl under the namespace pcl16.  This means all instances of pcl namespace need to be search replaced with pcl16.  You can find 'pcl_script.sh' in the same folder as this guide.  It will recurse through folders, searching and replacing pcl with pcl16 on source files and CMakeLists files.

if you need a newer version, or trunk, or an editable version, you can check out the following into your ros_workspace

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/macmason/perception_pcl_fuerte_unstable
rosmake pcl16_ros

edit the Makefile under pcl16 to change the version of pcl you want to check out

this also has the pcl16 namespace

openni
-----------

openni_camera does not have any launch files, it only contains the driver
You now need to launch openni with openni_launch package:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 

It will complain that the kinect is not calibrated, that's not problem
You may also see 
[ERROR] [1348256204.610247227]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/compressedDepth/set_parameters]
This also doesn't seem to be a problem

You may use the original topics, however you can now also used the "registered" topics, where corrections are done based on camera intrinsics to get rid of lense distortion
- To use this open dynamic reconfigure
	rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui 
- select /camera/driver
- select depth_registration.  This is also a parameter you can set in a launch file <arg name="depth_registration" default="true" />
- use the topics /camera/depth_registered/image_rect and /camera/rgb/image_rect_color

This is all explained in more detail here
