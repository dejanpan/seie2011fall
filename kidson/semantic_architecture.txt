General:
Distributed architecture

Floor and Ceiling and Wall Segmenter
input: axis aligned pointcloud
output: floor, ceiling and wall point clouds + the rest, parametric model, extents
functionality: segments the floor, the ceiling and the walls
algorithms: 
todo: interactive or not


Plane Segmenter
inputs: orientation, rest point cloud from "Floor and Ceiling and Wall Segmenter", seed points
outputs: plane point clouds + rest, parametric model, extents
functionality: horizontal planes, vertical planes, support various plane segmentation algorithms (various ransac-based methods, region growing, hough-voting, etc)
algorithms:  
todo: interactive or not


Fixture Segmenter
inputs: fixture type, rest point cloud from "Plane Segmenter", seed points
outputs: fixture point clouds + rest, parametric model, extents
functionality: handles (on cabinet doors, drawers and doors), knobs, tap, 
algorithms:   
todo: interactive or not


Spatio-Temporal Difference Segmenter
inputs: rest point cloud from "Floor and Ceiling and Wall Segmenter" or plane point clouds from Plane Segmenter or fixture point clouds  from Fixture Segmenter, robot or not
outputs: plane point clouds, parametric model, extents
functionality: spatio-temporal segmentation, registration with the rest of the model, calculation of a depth, articulation model
algorithms:   
todo: interactive or not
