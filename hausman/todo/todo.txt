Open questions:
3d clustering-?
3d tracking-?-> Ryohei Ueda -student -> get it to work first

Urgent:
making the launch file- improve
document the things in the code- clean up

Self-development:
gdb tutorials or debugging in eclipse
udacity courses about programming
checking the code with someone else- check the groups in the web
learn gtest
learn OPENMP

More fun:
go to Tangelmann and make the pictures of the objects there, push them and try it out- Try in the lab first

Improve what we have:
GUI in Qt
correct the pose estimation

Ideas and cooperating:
new approaches for occlusions: multiple views(another camera in the hand) or modelling of unknown spaces
simulating of clustering hypothesis- Sid
Improve the math - Zoltan
Prior knowledge from Luci from 3d static segmentation- Dejan pushes
Berlin guys

3d-tracking:
refactor the code
commit to the pcl
check the stability of tracking in matlab/octave
test the pipeline
do the tutorial

~more in release steps and road map txt files

To try out maybe:
idea with the planes tracking until they are not separated
match the rectangles to the point cloud as different features
check the world's state on static segmentation
