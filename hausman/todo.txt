Open questions:
3d clustering-?
3d tracking-?-> Ryohei Ueda -student -> get it to work first

Urgent:
making the launch file- improve
document the things in the code- clean up
tutorials

Icra workshops:
write the one page abstract for the project
prepare demonstration with one kinect(without the robot)
https://ias.cs.tum.edu/events/spmk-icra2012

More fun:
go to Tangelmann and make the pictures of the objects there, push them and try it out- Try in the lab first

Improve what we have:
GUI in Qt
correct the pose estimation
compare with normal segmentation: http://www.cs.brown.edu/~pff/segment/

Ideas and cooperating:
new approaches for occlusions: multiple views(another camera in the hand) or modelling of unknown spaces
simulating of clustering hypothesis- Sid
Improve the math - Zoltan
Textureless objects tracking- Antonis Agyros from FORTH - practical students?
Reconstruction of the full object model - not sparse anymore
Prior knowledge from Luci from 3d static segmentation- Dejan pushes

3d-tracking:
check the stability of tracking in matlab/octave
improve corners and lines-> check number of planes in the neighborhood

make a patch for checkout from pcl
improve the code
estimate convex corners in the Chris' way

To try out maybe:
idea with the planes tracking until they are not separated
match the rectangles to the point cloud as different features
check the world's state on static segmentation
