5. Make a robot version for interactive_segmentation_textureless.
6. Incorporate motion planner into both interactive segmentation packages.
7. Talk to the guys from Berlin and agree on the framework where we can combine our code.
8. Talk to Michael and see if the interactive perception can be useful in one of the demos.
9. Keep in touch with Sarah and see if interactive perception can be useful for her.
10. Get deeper into Man in the loop problem that Sarah is working on.
