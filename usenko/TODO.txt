- continue with the fern-based classification 
 - features (detector and descriptor), matchers and pose fitters =>  would be great if it is general
 - big and small objects
 - textured and textureless objects
 - transparent objects
 - cluttered vs non-cluttered objects
 - occlusions

- hough voting
 - problem with the generation of scans
 - run the algorithm on RCE
 - rim clustering as FFI => see if it runs on octave
 - test icp fitting (Dejan)
 - more initial rotations for ICP

- read paper by Wohlkinger and Drost

- models from KinFu => see of Ross can improve the model generation
